# 🌦️ Real-Time Weather Dashboard | Power BI Project

This project showcases a **Real-Time Weather Dashboard** built using **Power BI**, which dynamically fetches and visualizes weather data through an external **Weather API**. The dashboard is designed to be clean, interactive, and informative, allowing users to explore current weather metrics and forecasts across multiple cities.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Live Data Integration:** Connected Power BI to a real-time Weather API using `Get Data → Web`.
* **Data Transformation:** Cleaned and structured the API response using **Power Query Editor**.
* **Interactive Dashboard Components:**

  * **Cards** for displaying key metrics like Temperature, Humidity, and Pressure
  * **Gauges** for visualizing Wind Speed
  * **Line Chart** for Weather Forecast trends
  * **Donut Chart** for Air Quality Index (AQI)
  * **Stacked Column Chart** for Rain Probability
  * **Filters/Slicers** to switch between cities dynamically
* **Visual Enhancements:**

  * Custom **icons** representing current weather conditions
  * Custom **background image** designed using **Canva** for a clean UI/UX

## 📊 Key Insights & Recommendations

### 🔍 **Key Insights:**

1. **Real-Time Monitoring:**
   The dashboard provides **up-to-the-minute weather updates**, making it useful for both personal planning and operational decisions in industries like logistics, travel, and events.

2. **City-Level Comparisons:**
   Dynamic filters allow users to compare **weather conditions across multiple cities**, making it easier to understand **regional climate variations**.

3. **Forecast Trends:**
   Line charts help visualize **temperature and humidity forecasts**, allowing users to anticipate and prepare for weather changes in the coming days.

4. **Air Quality Awareness:**
   The **donut chart** provides a quick view of the **Air Quality Index (AQI)**, which is critical for individuals with health sensitivities or outdoor plans.

5. **Rain Probability Analysis:**
   The **stacked column chart** reveals hourly or daily **chances of rainfall**, useful for scheduling and event planning.

### 💡 **Recommendations:**

* **Alert System Integration:**
  Add conditional formatting or automated alerts to notify users when weather conditions reach critical thresholds (e.g., high AQI, heavy rainfall).

* **Historical Trend Analysis:**
  Combine real-time data with historical weather data to identify **long-term patterns** and **climate shifts**.

* **Mobile-Friendly Version:**
  Consider publishing this dashboard to the **Power BI Service** with a mobile view for on-the-go accessibility.

* **More Environmental Factors:**
  Extend the dashboard with data on **UV index**, **sunrise/sunset times**, or **weather warnings** for a more holistic overview.

* **User Personalization:**
  Allow users to **set a default city** and receive customized views or insights based on their location.
